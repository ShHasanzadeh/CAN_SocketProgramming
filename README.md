# CAN_SocketProgramming
## C++ SocketCAN Programming

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use SocketCAN in C++ for communication with CAN (Controller Area Network) devices. SocketCAN is a set of open-source CAN drivers and a networking stack that allows communication with CAN devices using standard Linux sockets.

## Features

- Sending and receiving CAN messages.
- Support for different CAN protocols.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with CAN networks.
- Example applications for basic CAN operations.

## Prerequisites

- Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu).
- `gcc` or `g++` installed for compiling C++ code.
- `can-utils` package for CAN utilities (optional, for testing).
- A CAN interface (e.g., USB-to-CAN adapter or a Raspberry Pi with CAN support).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShHasanzadeh/CAN_SocketProgramming.git
   cd SocketCAN_Test
